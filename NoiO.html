 			<br><p>Hello my name is Noi OBrien. I am currently an Opthalmic Technician at the Lasik Vision Institute. I have been a technician for 10 years and am looking for a career change. I hope to become a software developer in the near future. I always have been curious about how websites are created and programming languages. I am confident and will reach that goal by becoming a graduate of DevCode Bootcamp.
 			</p>
 	
 			<p>My interests are real estate investing and home renovations. My husband and I worked on one house so far and hope to do more. It was a lot of work but worth it to see a run down house look new again. We have two rental properties and currently renovating our house. I love to travel to anywhere warm and near an ocean is perfect. I am not a fan of the cold weather. I may take up skiing just to get me excited for the winter season. So far I have gone tubing and that's as adventerous as I get. I don't mind the snow when it first falls since it's very pretty on the trees and ground. <br><br> <p>I also love photography. Each Christmas as a tradition I take our Christmas card pictures. My husband hates getting dressed up in the outfit of my choosing and smiling for the camera. My daughter has fun taking the pictures. <br><br> <p>I am married and have an 8 year old daughter. I have a dog and a cat who are both adopted. I call them my fur babies. They somewhat are friends. I have a big heart for animals. I have always lived in Wisconsin. I did move from Milwaukee to Waukesha to Delafield and this is the furthest west I have lived from Milwaukee. If my husband had it his way, we would be in Madison right now. </p>
