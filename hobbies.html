 		<br><h3><strong><Real Estate</strong></h3>
 	</body>

 	<p>
 		I love anything and <strong>EVERYTHING</strong> real estate. Who wouldn't like to retire early and have passive income coming in? Well I am always looking for opportunities for investments on Zillow and other realtor sites for that reason. I am hoping to grow my portfolio and grow my passive income. I sometimes attend real estate groups to network with other investors. I would like a large apartment complex or multiple 4 or 8 family units and would also like a condo in Florida with the view of the ocean. 
 		<br> 
 		<p>I appreciate buildings old and new. Going into old homes and envisioning a redesign is really fun and challenging sometimes. Taking a staging or design class would be beneficial to gain more knowledge in the design area.
 		I get inspiration from my favorite TV network HGTV. Eventually I would like to also volunteer with Habitat for Humanity. They do a lot of projects on Saturdays and I work on Saturdays currently.

 		<h4>My favorite shows are as follows:</h4>
 		<ul>
 			<li>Property Brothers</li>
 			<li>Fixer Upper</li>
 			<li>Love It or List It</li>
 		</ul>

 		<h4>Home Renovation Projects</h4> 		<p>
 			Demo day and reveal day are my two favorite moments during the renovation process. Demo day is a lot of destruction, however it's nice to see the house ready for the new updated materials. The reveal when everything is staged is very rewarding. Its seeing our hard work pay off. Each project is a learning experience. Some were more challenging than others.

 		<ul>
 			<li>Tiling</li>
 			<li>Painting</li>
 		</ul>

 		<h4>Photography</h4>
 		<p>
 			I gained an interest in photography in high school when they had the old dark rooms and had to develop the film. I have a DSLR Nikon D3500 camera. The Nikon takes the most amazing pictures. I like to edit the pictures and have fun with the pictures. I live by a wooded trail and am surrounded by nature so it's easy to click a pic anytime. I especially love to take pictures of animals and people as well.
